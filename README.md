# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project was created as part of my learning journey in JavaScript, focusing on functions and loops.

## Project Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two players. In this project, you can play against the computer. The game is played in rounds, and the first player to score 3 points wins the game.

## Features

- **Initial Version**: The game was initially played with human input and the output was displayed in the console.
- **Updated Version**: The game now has a user interface (UI) and is played using buttons in the UI.
- **Best of 5**: The game is played in a "Best of 5" format, where the first player to score 3 points wins.

## How to Play

1. Click the "Play" button to start the game.
2. Choose your hand (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) by clicking the corresponding button.
3. The computer will randomly choose its hand.
4. The result of each round will be displayed, and the scores will be updated.
5. The game ends when either the player or the computer scores 3 points. A message will be displayed indicating the winner.
